<h1><u>K-Medoids Clustering algorithm </u></h1>
<b>
<p>       K-Medoids (also called as Partitioning Around Medoid) algorithm was proposed in 1987 by Kaufman and Rousseeuw. A medoid can be defined as the point in the cluster, whose dissimilarities with all the other points in the cluster is minimum.The k-medoids algorithm is a clustering approach related to k-means clustering for partitioning a data set into k groups or clusters. In k-medoids clustering, each cluster is represented by one of the data point in the cluster. These points are named cluster medoids.
</p>
<p>The term medoid refers to an object within a cluster for which average dissimilarity between it and all the other the members of the cluster is minimal. It corresponds to the most centrally located point in the cluster. </p>
<p>K-medoid is a robust alternative to k-means clustering. This means that, the algorithm is less sensitive to noise and outliers, compared to k-means, because it uses medoids as cluster centers instead of means (used in k-means).The k-medoids algorithm requires the user to specify k, the number of clusters to be generated</p>
<h3>Uses of k medoids algorithm</h3>
<ul>
    <b>
        <li>It is simple to understand and easy to implement.</li>
        <li>K-Medoid Algorithm is fast and converges in a fixed number of steps.</li>
    </b>
