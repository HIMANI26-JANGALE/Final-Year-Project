<h1><u>DBSCAN Clustering algorithm </u></h1>
<b>
<p>        Density-Based Clustering refers to unsupervised learning methods that identify distinctive groups/clusters in the data, based on the idea that a cluster in data space is a contiguous region of high point density,<br> separated from other such clusters by contiguous regions of low point density. Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) is a base algorithm for density-based clustering. <br>It can discover clusters of different shapes and sizes from a large amount of data, which is containing noise and outliers.
</p>
<p>The DBSCAN algorithm uses two parameters:</p>

<ul><b>
<li>minPts: The minimum number of points (a threshold) clustered together for a region to be considered dense.</li>
<li>eps (Îµ): A distance measure that will be used to locate the points in the neighborhood of any point.</li>
</b>
</ul>
<p>These parameters can be understood if we explore two concepts called Density Reachability and Density Connectivity.</p>
<ul>
    
<li>Reachability in terms of density establishes a point to be reachable from another if it lies within a particular distance (eps) from it.</li>
<li>Connectivity, on the other hand, involves a transitivity based chaining-approach to determine whether points are located in a particular cluster. For example, p and q points could be connected if p->r->s->t->q, where a->b means b is in the neighborhood of a.</li>
</ul>
